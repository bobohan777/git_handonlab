**Step 1: Static Web Hosting**

AWS Amplify hosts static web resources including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files which are loaded in the user's browser.



**Step 2: User Management**

Amazon Cognito provides user management and authentication functions to secure the backend API.



**Step 3: Serverless Backend**

Amazon DynamoDB provides a persistence layer where data can be stored by the API's Lambda function.



**Step 4: RESTful API**

JavaScript executed in the browser sends and receives data from a public backend API built using Lambda and API Gateway.
